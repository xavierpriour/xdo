# NOTE
# There is currently a bug on docker-machine.
# The service file it creates in /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/10-machine.conf has an incorrect command
# We need to remove it, then restart.
# At this point the service file at /lib/systemd/system/docker.service takes precedence (and it has the right command)
#
# Then we can:
# - finish install: xdo $stg create --force
# - regen cert if needed: docker-machine regenerate-certs $stg-all-1

# setup docker to restart on reboot
#sshExec "sudo systemctl enable docker"
# setup iptables to load rules on reboot
#sudo systemctl enable iptables-restore
