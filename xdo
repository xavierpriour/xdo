# - $1 is environment, should be specified in ./stages/$1
# - $2 is optional action, can be env-specific in ./stages/$1/$2.sh or generic in ./stages/$2.sh
# - rest is arguments, or complete command if no action is specified.
#
# This script does some checks then loads environment variables from various folders
# (applying reasonable priority rules) and makes them available to the action scripts.
# It can even execute arbitrary commands, with all env variables.

# Examples:
# - use specific action to connect: ./do pre connect xavier.priour@as
# - execute arbitrary code:  ./do pre docker logs pre_datanimist_1
